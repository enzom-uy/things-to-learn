# Programming stuff

### I'll try to organize this based on what I think is the most important before learning the next thing.

1. Because I'm still learning basic React, I think it should be better to learn the most used hooks alongside useState,
   useEffect and useContext before going to Typescript:
    - [useMemo](https://es.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo) (React hook for memoization of expensive computations or functions)
    - [useReducer](https://es.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) (React hook for managing state in a functional component)
    - [useCallback](https://es.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) (React hook for memoizing callbacks and avoiding performance pitfalls)
    - [React 18](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html) (New stuff in React 18)

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (better javascript)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) (promise based HTTP client)
- [Redux](https://es.redux.js.org/) (State container for React apps)
- [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) (State container for React apps. It's an alternative to Redux for medium-sized apps)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (testing framework)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (testing framework)
- [React Query](https://es.redux.js.org/) (State container for React apps. It's an alternative to Redux for big apps)
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) (UI components library for react)
- [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) (eslint plugin for react hooks)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) (Open Source form library for React & React Native)
